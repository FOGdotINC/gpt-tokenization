#WHAT THIS PYTHON SCRIPT DOES:

#This is a python script that takes a text input 'hello world' 
#and converts the text into tokens using the GPT2 architecture: [31373, 995]
#It also shows the relationship between text and it's respective tensor token 
#Text: Tensor Token 
#  hello: 31373
#  world: 995

#TECNICAL DESCRIPTION

In this script, the transformers.GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2') line loads the GPT-2 tokenizer. 
The tokenizer.encode() function is then used to convert the text into numerical tokens. 
The return_tensors argument specifies that the output should be a PyTorch tensor, but you can also choose to return a list of integers if desired. 
The output of the tokenization process is a tensor of numerical tokens that represent the relationship between words in the input text.

The other part of the script script demonstrates how the relationship between the words in the input text and the tokens
they are represented by can be observed by converting the tokens back to their corresponding words using the tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens() function.
